## File Handling in JavaScript

Working with files is fundamental to many JavaScript applications, from reading and writing data to managing configurations and logs. Mastering file handling allows developers to build more versatile and dynamic applications, whether for server-side scripting with Node.js or developing tools that require interaction with the file system.

In this chapter, weâ€™ll explore a range of powerful JavaScript functions designed to handle files efficiently. Understanding these functions is crucial for tasks such as reading from or writing to files, managing directories, and performing file operations like renaming or deleting.

Effective file handling is essential for creating applications that can manage data persistence, automate workflows, and process large datasets. Whether you're building a simple script or a complex application, having a solid grasp of these file-handling techniques will greatly enhance your ability to develop robust and scalable solutions in JavaScript.
